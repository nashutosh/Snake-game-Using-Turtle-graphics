nake Game Using Turtle Graphics
This project is a simple Snake Game developed using Python's turtle graphics. The game allows a player to control the movement of a snake on a canvas. The objective is to eat randomly appearing food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the screen boundaries or the snake's body. I have added text-to-speech (TTS) using the pyttsx3 library to explain the rules and announce the final score.

Features:
Move the snake: Control using W, A, S, and D keys.
Score tracking: Displays the player's score and the high score.
Food and growth: The snake grows as it eats food.
Voice interaction: Uses TTS to explain game rules and announce scores.
Dynamic difficulty: The snake's speed increases as it eats more food
turtle: For the graphical interface.
time: To handle delays in the game loop.
random: To randomly position the food.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech features.
The game window is created with a size of 650x650 pixels, a black background, and a title. The tracer(0) function prevents auto-updates, allowing for manual updates to the game screen.
